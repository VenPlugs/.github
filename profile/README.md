## Ven's Discord Plugins

Hello there! Here you can find all the plugins I've made for [Powercord](https://powercord.dev/) (and perhaps [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord) in the future ;))

If you run into any issues or have any requests, just open an issue or hit me up on Discord! 
You can ping me on the powercord server or just dm me: [Ven#8810](https://discord.com/users/343383572805058560)

## Installing

Installing plugins properly is crucial so that the Powercord Updater can take care of automagically updating them for you!

Luckily it's pretty simple, just open a command prompt in your plugin folder and run
```sh
git clone REPO_URL
```
